# Redish - A Simple Redis Clone in C

This project is a **basic Redis clone** written in C, built to help me understand:
- Key-value data storage
- Hash tables
- File persistence
- Command parsing
- (Later) Sockets and networking

##  Features (so far)
- `SET <key> <value>` to store data
- `GET <key>` to retrieve data
- Data stored in memory and saved to a file

##  Goals
- Learn low-level programming with C
- Build a functional in-memory key-value database
- Add file persistence
- (Later) Add support for multiple clients using sockets
